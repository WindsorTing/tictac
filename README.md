Command Line Tic Tac Toe

This is a command line version of Tic Tac Toe. Currently only works in linux/os x until I find a way to package it for Windows. If you know how to do the latter please contact me at windsor.ting@yahoo.ca.

If you are in linux/os x, download the tictactoe.py code file and run by: 
1) open command line
2) cd to download directory
3) run "python tictactoe.py"
4) enjoy!

The software is provided as is, with no warranty, under the GNU GPL v3 (more details in the code preamble). 

If you would like to help improve this program feel free to do so!

Best, 
Windsor
